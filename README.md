##Introduction

This plugin allows you to insert in a rich text box multimedia elements from the base of the `document` plugin.

Once installed, an integration service appears in the list when the user click the **L** button in the rich text editor.

##Configuration

The backoffice interface defines a mapping between the objects presented in service integration and document types in the database of the `document` plugin.

This plugin is an extension of the `document` plugin.
